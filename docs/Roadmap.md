## RoadMap

#### Version 3.0

The main focus for version 3.0 will be to upgrade the CST related capabilities.
This could mean many things:

*   CST customization support.
*   Skipping nodes in the created CST.
*   Node labeling
*   Performance optimizations for CST creation / Visitor.
*   ...

The objective is to make the CST and its utilities as user friendly and performant as possible
So there would be very little reason to use embedded actions.

#### ~~Version 2.0~~

The main focus of version 2.0 will be the addition of support for **custom declarative style APIs.**
Either Generator EBNF style API, Combinator Style APIs or even both.

This will enable Chevrotain to be used as the underlying engine for other parsing libraries.

#### [~~Version 1.0~~](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain/milestone/4)

The APIs have been pretty stable for a while so Version 1.0 is in the works.
This release will focus on improving the docs, adding a few more example grammars
and minor fixes.
